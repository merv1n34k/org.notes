Org.Notes is a server for managing tasks and notes for organisations. This,
however does not restrict you for your personal use, but the focus was on
multiplayer-by-default logic to make clear understanding of other people
progress.

## Setup/Run

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## Acknowledgment

This project would simply be impossible without the work [Lumen Labs](https://github.com/lumen-oss) team! They are
truly amazing, and I definitely recommend you to see their project.

The project is heavily based on the [Luanox server](https://beta.luanox.org) - A Lua module host for the Lux package manager, fully compatible with the rockspec format.
